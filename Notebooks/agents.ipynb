       "'Page: M√∂bius strip\\nSummary: In mathematics, a M√∂bius strip, M√∂bius band, or M√∂bius loop is a surface that can be formed by attaching the ends of a strip of paper together with a half-twist. As a mathematical object, it was discovered by Johann Benedict Listing and August Ferdinand M√∂bius in 1858, but it had already appeared in Roman mosaics from the third century CE. The M√∂bius strip is a non-orientable surface, meaning that within it one cannot consistently distinguish clockwise from counterclockwise turns. Every non-orientable surface contains a M√∂bius strip.\\nAs an abstract topological space, the M√∂bius strip can be embedded into three-dimensional Euclidean space in many different ways: a clockwise half-twist is different from a counterclockwise half-twist, and it can also be embedded with odd numbers of twists greater than one, or with a knotted centerline. Any two embeddings with the same knot for the centerline and the same number and direction of twists are topologically equivalent. All of these embeddings have only one side, but when embedded in other spaces, the M√∂bius strip may have two sides. It has only a single boundary curve.\\nSeveral geometric constructions of the M√∂bius strip provide it with additional structure. It can be swept as a ruled surface by a line segment rotating in a rotating plane, with or without self-crossings. A thin paper strip with its ends joined to form a M√∂bius strip can bend smoothly as a developable surface or be folded flat; the flattened M√∂bius strips include the trihexaflexagon. The Sudanese M√∂bius strip is a minimal surface in a hypersphere, and the Meeks M√∂bius strip is a self-intersecting minimal surface in ordinary Euclidean space. Both the Sudanese M√∂bius strip and another self-intersecting M√∂bius strip, the cross-cap, have a circular boundary. A M√∂bius strip without its boundary, called an open M√∂bius strip, can form surfaces of constant curvature. Certain highly symmetric spaces whose points represent lines in the plane have the shape of a M√∂bius strip.\\nThe many applications of M√∂bius strips include mechanical belts that wear evenly on both sides, dual-track roller coasters whose carriages alternate between the two tracks, and world maps printed so that antipodes appear opposite each other. M√∂bius strips appear in molecules and devices with novel electrical and electromechanical properties, and have been used to prove impossibility results in social choice theory. In popular culture, M√∂bius strips appear in artworks by M. C. Escher, Max Bill, and others, and in the design of the recycling symbol. Many architectural concepts have been inspired by the M√∂bius strip, including the building design for the NASCAR Hall of Fame. Performers including Harry Blackstone Sr. and Thomas Nelson Downs have based stage magic tricks on the properties of the M√∂bius strip. The canons of J. S. Bach have been analyzed using M√∂bius strips.

      "Summary: Artificial intelligence (AI) refers to the capability of computational systems to perform tasks typically associated with human intelligence, such as learning, reasoning, problem-solving, perception, and decision-making. It is a field of research in computer science that develops and studies methods and software that enable machines to perceive their environment and use learning and intelligence to take actions that maximize their chances of achieving defined goals. Such machines may be called AIs.\n",
      "High-profile applications of AI include advanced web search engines (e.g., Google Search); recommendation systems (used by YouTube, Amazon, and Netflix); virtual assistants (e.g., Google Assistant, Siri, and Alexa); autonomous vehicles (e.g., Waymo); generative and creative tools (e.g., ChatGPT and AI art); and superhuman play and analysis in strategy games (e.g., chess and Go). However, many AI applications are not perceived as AI: \"A lot of cutting edge AI has filtered into general applications, often without being called AI because once something becomes useful enough and common enough it's not labeled AI anymore.\"\n",
      "Various subfields of AI research are centered around particular goals and the use of particular tools. The traditional goals of AI research include learning, reasoning, knowledge representation, planning, natural language processing, perception, and support for robotics. General intelligence‚Äîthe ability to complete any task performed by a human on an at least equal level‚Äîis among the field's long-term goals. To reach these goals, AI researchers have adapted and integrated a wide range of techniques, including search and mathematical optimization, formal logic, artificial neural networks, and methods based on statistics, operations research, and economics. AI also draws upon psychology, linguistics, philosophy, neuroscience, and other fields.\n",
      "Artificial intelligence was founded as an academic discipline in 1956, and the field went through multiple cycles of optimism throughout its history, followed by periods of disappointment and loss of funding, known as AI winters. Funding and interest vastly increased after 2012 when deep learning outperformed previous AI techniques. This growth accelerated further after 2017 with the transformer architecture, and by the early 2020s many billions of dollars were being invested in AI and the field experienced rapid ongoing progress in what has become known as the AI boom. The emergence of advanced generative AI in the midst of the AI boom and its ability to create and modify content exposed several unintended consequences and harms in the present and raised concerns about the risks of AI and its long-term effects in the future, prompting discussions about regulatory policies to ensure the safety and benefits of the technology.\n",

      "Summary: Artificial general intelligence (AGI) is a type of highly autonomous artificial intelligence (AI) that matches or surpasses human cognitive capabilities across most or all economically valuable work or cognitive labor. This contrasts with narrow AI, which is limited to specific tasks. Artificial superintelligence (ASI), on the other hand, refers to AGI that greatly exceeds human cognitive capabilities. AGI is considered one of the definitions of strong AI.\n",
      "Creating AGI is a primary goal of AI research and of companies such as OpenAI, Google, and Meta. A 2020 survey identified 72 active AGI research and development projects across 37 countries.\n",
      "The timeline for achieving AGI remains a subject of ongoing debate among researchers and experts. As of 2023, some argue that it may be possible in years or decades; others maintain it might take a century or longer; a minority believe it may never be achieved; and another minority claims that it is already here. Notable AI researcher Geoffrey Hinton has expressed concerns about the rapid progress towards AGI, suggesting it could be ach\u001b[0m\n",

      "Final Answer: Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a branch of computer science focused on creating systems that can perform tasks that typically require human intelligence. These tasks can include learning, reasoning, problem-solving, perception, and understanding natural language. AI can be categorized into narrow AI, which is designed for specific tasks, and artificial general intelligence (AGI), which refers to a hypothetical AI that could understand, learn, and apply its intelligence flexibly across a wide range of tasks, equivalent to or surpassing human cognitive capabilities.

      "Summary: In machine learning, a neural network (also artificial neural network or neural net, abbreviated ANN or NN) is a model inspired by the structure and function of biological neural networks in animal brains.\n",
      "A neural network consists of connected units or nodes called artificial neurons, which loosely model the neurons in the brain. Artificial neuron models that mimic biological neurons more closely have also been recently investigated and shown to significantly improve performance. These are connected by edges, which model the synapses in the brain. Each artificial neuron receives signals from connected neurons, then processes them and sends a signal to other connected neurons. The \"signal\" is a real number, and the output of each neuron is computed by some non-linear function of the sum of its inputs, called the activation function. The strength of the signal at each connection is determined by a weight, which adjusts during the learning process.\n",
      "Typically, neurons are aggregated into layers. Different layers may perform different transformations on their inputs. Signals travel from the first layer (the input layer) to the last layer (the output layer), possibly passing through multiple intermediate layers (hidden layers). A network is typically called a deep neural network if it has at least two hidden layers.\n",
      "Artificial neural networks are used for various tasks, including predictive modeling, adaptive control, and solving problems in artificial intelligence. They can learn from experience, and can derive conclusions from a complex and seemingly unrelated set of information.\n",

      "Summary: These datasets are used in machine learning (ML) research and have been cited in peer-reviewed academic journals. Datasets are an integral part of the field of machine learning. Major advances in this field can result from advances in learning algorithms (such as deep learning), computer hardware, and, less-intuitively, the availability of high-quality training datasets. High-quality labeled training datasets for supervised and semi-supervised machine learning algorithms are usually difficult and expensive to produce because of the large amount of time needed to label the data. Although they do not need to be labeled, high-quality datasets for unsupervised learning can also be difficult and costly to produce.\n",
      "Many organizations, including governments, publish and share their datasets. The datasets are classified, based on the licenses, as Open data and Non-Open data.\n",
      "The datasets from various governmental-bodies are presented in List of open government data sites. The datasets are ported on open data portals. They are made available for searching, depositing and accessing through interfaces like Open API.  The datasets are made available as various sorted types and subtypes.\n",

      "The most common use of the term refers to machine learning algorithms for the analysis of classical data executed on a quantum computer, i.e. quantum-enhanced machine learning. While machine learning algorithms are used to compute immense quantities of data, quantum machine learning utilizes qubits and quantum operations or specialized quantum systems to improve computational speed and data storage done by algorithms in a program. This includes hybrid methods that involve both classical and quantum processing, where computationally difficult subroutines are outsourced to a quantum device. These routines can be more complex in nature and executed faster on a quantum computer. Furthermore, quantum algorithms can be used to analyze quantum states instead of classical data.\n",

      "Summary: Learning is the process of acquiring new understanding, knowledge, behaviors, skills, values, attitudes, and preferences. The ability to learn is possessed by humans, non-human animals, and some machines; there is also evidence for some kind of learning in certain plants. Some learning is immediate, induced by a single event (e.g. being burned by a hot stove), but much skill and knowledge accumulate from repeated experiences. The changes induced by learning often last a lifetime, and it is hard to distinguish learned material that seems to be \"lost\" from that which cannot be retrieved.\n",
      "Human learning starts at birth (it might even start before) and continues until death as a consequence of ongoing interactions between people and their environment. The nature and processes involved in learning are studied in many established fields (including educational psychology, neuropsychology, experimental psychology, cognitive sciences, and pedagogy), as well as emerging fields of knowledge (e.g. with a shared interest in the topic of learning from safety events such as incidents/accidents, or in collaborative learning health systems). Research in such fields has led to the identification of various sorts of learning. For example, learning may occur as a result of habituation, or classical conditioning, operant conditioning or as a result of more complex activities such as play, seen only in relatively intelligent animals. Learning may occur consciously or without conscious awareness. Learning that an aversive event cannot be avoided or escaped may result in a condition called learned helplessness. There is evidence for human behavioral learning prenatally, in which habituation has been observed as early as 32 weeks into gestation, indicating that the central nervous system is sufficiently developed and primed for learning and memory to occur very early on in development.\n",
      "Play has been approached by several theorists as a form of learning. Children experiment with the world, learn the rules, and learn to interact through play. Lev Vygotsky agrees that play is pivotal for children's development, since they make meaning of their environment through playing educational games. For Vygotsky, however, play is the first form of learning language and communication, and the stage where a child begins to understand rules and symbols. This has led to a view that learning in organisms is always related to semiosis, and is often associated with representational systems/activity.\n",

      "Page: Data structure\n",
      "Summary: In computer science, a data structure is a data organization and storage format that is usually chosen for efficient access to data. More precisely, a data structure is a collection of data values, the relationships among them, and the functions or operations that can be applied to the data, i.e., it is an algebraic structure about data.\n",

      "Page: Collaborative learning\n",
      "Summary: Collaborative learning is a situation in which two or more people learn or attempt to learn something together. Unlike individual learning, people engaged in collaborative learning capitalize on one another's resources and skills (asking one another for information, evaluating one another's ideas, monitoring one another's work, etc.). More specifically, collaborative learning is based on the model that knowledge can be created within a population where members actively interact by sharing experiences and take on asymmetric roles. Put differently, collaborative learning refers to methodologies and environments in which learners engage in a common task where each individual depends on and is accountable to each other. These include both face-to-face conversations and computer discussions (online forums, chat rooms, etc.). Methods for examining collaborative learning processes include conversation analysis and statistical discourse analysis.\n",
      "Thus, collaborative learning is commonly illustrated when groups of students work together to search for unders\u001b[0m\n",
      "Thought:\u001b[32;1m\u001b[1;3mThought: The Wikipedia search results did not yield the information I anticipated. The page on \"Learning\" was more general and not specific to machine learning, while \"Data Structure\" and \"Collaborative Learning\" did not directly address the fundamentals of machine learning. However, we can still utilize the video resource identified earlier and perhaps suggest additional resources directly relevant to the topic.\n",
      "\n",
      "Final Answer: While the text-based resources I initially found didn't directly address the fundamentals of machine learning, I recommend starting with the video \"The Complete Machine Learning Roadmap\" from Programming with Mosh, which you can find at the following URL: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IgVGSaQPaw](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IgVGSaQPaw). \n",

Cloud applications and data analytics represent a disruptive change in the ways that society is informed by, and uses information. We start the first week by introducing some major systems for data analysis including Spark and the major frameworks and distributions of analytics applications including Hortonworks, Cloudera, and MapR. By the middle of week one we introduce the HDFS distributed and robust file system that is used in many applications like Hadoop and finish week one by exploring the powerful MapReduce programming model and how distributed operating systems like YARN and Mesos support a flexible and scalable environment for Big Data analytics. In week two, our course introduces large scale data storage and the difficulties and problems of consensus in enormous stores that use quantities of processors, memories and disks. We discuss eventual consistency, ACID, and BASE and the consensus algorithms used in data centers including Paxos and Zookeeper. Our course presents Distributed Key-Value Stores and in memory databases like Redis used in data centers for performance. Next we present NOSQL Databases. We visit HBase, the scalable, low latency database that supports database operations in applications that use Hadoop. Then again we show how Spark SQL can program SQL queries on huge data. We finish up week two with a presentation on Distributed Publish/Subscribe systems using Kafka, a distributed log messaging system that is finding wide use in connecting Big Data and streaming applications together to form complex systems. Week three moves to fast data real-time streaming and introduces Storm technology that is used widely in industries such as Yahoo. We continue with Spark Streaming, Lambda and Kappa architectures, and a presentation of the Streaming Ecosystem. Week four focuses on Graph Processing, Machine Learning, and Deep Learning. We introduce the ideas of graph processing and present Pregel, Giraph, and Spark GraphX. Then we move to machine learning with examples from Mahout and Spark. Kmeans, Naive Bayes, and fpm are given as examples. Spark ML and Mllib continue the theme of programmability and application construction. The last topic we cover in week four introduces Deep Learning technologies including Theano, Tensor Flow, CNTK, MXnet, and Caffe on Spark.',\n",

      "Women empowerment is a critical global movement aimed at achieving gender equality and enhancing the status and rights of women across all spheres of life. Its essence lies in providing women with the necessary tools, resources, and opportunities to achieve their full potential and become active participants and leaders in societal, economic, and political processes. This empowerment is not just beneficial for women themselves but also contributes significantly to the development of communities and nations as a whole.\n",
      "\n",
      "### The Need for Empowerment\n",
      "\n",
      "Historically, women have faced systemic discrimination and marginalization in various areas, including education, employment, healthcare, and political representation. In many parts of the world, cultural norms and legal frameworks have perpetuated these inequalities, limiting women's access to opportunities and resources. Empowerment seeks to address these disparities by promoting equal rights and opportunities, dismantling patriarchal structures, and fostering a culture of respect and equality.\n",

      "\n",
      "Economic empowerment is fundamental to women's independence and well-being. It involves providing women with the resources and opportunities to participate fully in economic activities, earn income, and manage assets. This not only improves their economic status but also enhances their decision-making power within households and communities. Economic empowerment programs often focus on vocational training, financial literacy, and access to credit.\n",
      "\n",
      "#### Social Empowerment\n",
      "\n",
      "Social empowerment refers to the ability of women to influence social norms and practices that affect their lives. It involves challenging and changing societal attitudes and beliefs that perpetuate gender inequality. Social empowerment activities can include awareness campaigns, education programs, and community-based initiatives that promote gender equality and women's rights.\n",
      "\n",
      "#### Political Empowerment\n",
      "\n",
      "Political empowerment is about increasing women's participation in political processes and decision-making at all levels. It includes increasing the number of women in political offices, enhancing their influence in policy-making, and ensuring that their voices are heard in governance structures. Political empowerment is vital for creating policies and laws that address the specific needs and issues faced by women.\n",
      "\n",
      "#### Psychological Empowerment\n",
      "\n",
      "Psychological empowerment involves building confidence, self-esteem, and a sense of agency in women. This can be achieved through education, counseling, and support groups that help women overcome barriers and challenges. Psychological empowerment is crucial for women to believe in their ability to effect change and pursue their goals.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Challenges and Strategies\n",
      "\n",
      "Despite significant progress, women's empowerment remains an ongoing process, facing numerous challenges such as cultural resistance, lack of support, and legal barriers. Strategies to overcome these challenges include:\n",
      "\n",
      "- **Education and Awareness:** Increasing awareness about the importance of women's empowerment and educating communities about the benefits of gender equality.\n",
      "- **Policy and Legal Reforms:** Implementing and enforcing laws that protect women's rights and penalize gender-based discrimination and violence.\n",
      "- **Support Networks:** Building support networks and platforms where women can share experiences, learn from one another, and advocate for change collectively.\n",
      "- **Economic Opportunities:** Creating and supporting initiatives that provide women with economic opportunities and financial independence.\n",
      "- **Political Participation:** Encouraging and facilitating women‚Äôs participation in political processes and ensuring their representation in decision-making roles.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Conclusion\n",
      "\n",
      "Women empowerment is a multifaceted process that requires concerted efforts from all sectors of society. It is not just about empowering women but also about transforming societal structures and norms to ensure that all individuals, regardless of gender, have equal opportunities and rights. By investing in women's empowerment, societies can achieve not only gender equality but also broader social, economic, and political development. The journey towards true empowerment is ongoing and requires continuous commitment and action from both women and those who support them.\n",
